# [Flavours of Physics](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics)

This was machine learning competition hosted on kaggle in which aim of the challenge was to find a phenomenon that is not already known to exist – charged lepton flavour violation – thereby helping to establish new physics.

This is one of the most interesting projects I have worked on. We were given real data from the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, mixed with simulated datasets of the decay.
Submission was tricky as it was suppose to first pass an [agreement test](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/details/agreement-test) and then a [correlation test](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics/details/correlation-test).

For me basic feature extraction was enough to make it pass the tests. I was able to get a Weighted Area Under the ROC Curve score of 0.982138 with gradient boosting using XGboost. 

Frankly this competition taught me more about physics than Machine Learning. For me it was great experience to get an insight of work which is carried around in CERN and a great opportunity to work with real data from LHC(Large Hadron Collider).
